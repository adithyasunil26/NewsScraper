Fewer than 20% of Indian Americans are said to have backed Trump in 2016. That number is expected to rise after Prime Minister Narendra Modi nudged the community to support Trump when he said \u201cab ki baar, Trump sarkar\u201d at the joint rally at Houston last September.\n\nIt is not inconceivable, despite ongoing protests over the murder of George Floyd, that a section of Indian Americans may yet vote for Trump in the November\u2019s election. The question is do they realise that their support for Trump\u2019s second term would amount to signing on for more Christianisation of the US?\n\nTrump is pandering to his religious base because he is dependent on the Christian Right for his re-election. As the Christian activist Ralph Reed once explained the importance of the Christian right for the Republican party:\n\n\u201cIf you take evangelicals who are 27% of the electorate and you add to them 11% of the electorate that are frequent Mass-attending Catholic, it\u2019s 38% of the electorate, and 56% of the entire Republican vote nationwide. If that vote goes away, the Republican Party ceases to exist as a reliable political party.\u201d\n\nIn turn, the Christian Right has been organising for decades preparing for a figure like Trump and has used his presidency to extend its political and cultural reach.\n\nIndian Americans and India\u2019s middle class need to reckon with these realities and their effects. Two new important books provide a firm grasp on the phenomena of increasing power of the Christian Right and white nationalists in Trump\u2019s America. Katherine Stewart\u2019s The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism and Sarah Posner\u2019s Unholy: Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump offer a fascinating glimpse of the individuals, organiaations and networks that are working to wrest power away from the Democrats and traditional moderate Republicans within the GOP. Importantly, they also highlight how the Christian Right is linking up right-wing movements in Russia and Europe, changing Western political cultures from within, in ways that they will not be friendly to immigrants and foreigners.\n\nA little bit of genealogy is in order. The conservative, dominant strand of the Christian Right began to organise politically to counter the end of segregation in public schools which the federal government was pushing following the Supreme Court\u2019s 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There is an erroneous belief that the evangelical foray into politics was motivated by outrage over the Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. In actual fact, Protestant evangelicals were not opposed to abortion in the early 1970s as Roman Catholics were. Posner points out that the Southern Baptist Convention approved a resolution two years before Roe allowing for legal abortion \u201cunder such circumstances as rape, incest, clear evidence of fetal abnormality\u201d and where the emotional, mental and physical health of the mother was threatened. The famous preacher Billy Graham also indicated in 1970 that abortion was permissible in certain circumstances, before becoming more hardline on the issue.\n\nOpposition to Civil Rights movement\n\nThe Christian Right was opposed to the grant of civil rights for African Americans and expansion of freedoms for women in the 1960s. And for much of the 1970s, it was preoccupied with saving the tax-exempt status of private Christian schools that practiced segregation. It also opposed busing and the changing diverse content of textbooks used in public schools. It blamed the Left for these advances and the erosion of Christian values and was to hit upon abortion later in the decade as the single-ticket issue that could rally its followers.\n\nChristian ideologues like Paul Weyrich set their sights on \u201cproducing a form of government more congenial to conservatism.\u201d This they did by creating organisations and networks to intellectually challenge the Left and forged ties with wealthy funders and politicians. Weyrich, who was eventually rated as one among the \u201cfour pillars of modern conservatism,\u201d the others being Barry Goldwater, William F. Buckley Jr. and Ronald Reagan, founded or played a critical role in a number of prominent right-wing institutions, including the Heritage Foundation, The American Legislative Exchange Council and the Council for National Policy, \u201ca networking organization for social conservative activists that the New York Times once referred to as a \u2018little-known group of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the country.\u2019\u201d\n\nStewart\u2019s Power Worshippers, which reads like a retrospective template on how a religion can take over a state, carefully unveils \u201cChristian nationalism,\u201d which is driven by influential and wealthy conservatives and religious leaders who are focused on turning America into a Christian nation by capturing power at the national, state and local level while shaping the narrative on key political and cultural issues. The movement has since morphed into an ecosystem of networked individuals and organizations who seek to transform American politics, the legal system, schools and healthcare through elected politicians, litigation and intellectual combat in the public sphere via televangelists, radio show hosts, conservative think tanks, advocacy groups and so on.\n\nChristian nationalists have a particular reading on US history \u2014 they believe that God ordained the country to be a Christian nation and think that the separation of church and state is a profound misreading of America\u2019s founding and destiny. They believe that Christians should be in positions of governmental authority and exercise dominion in line with their beliefs. According to the late preacher Peter Wagner, Christians should gain control of seven \u201cmountains\u201d of culture and influence including government, business, education, the media, the arts and entertainment, family and religion.\n\nConservative Christians pit themselves against everything that stands in the way of their cultural project, be it the liberals, the intellectual left, gays and feminists, who, according to them, are subverting traditional sexual mores, gender roles and promoting abortion. And in these culture wars Christian figures often band together with non-religious conservatives and those on the Far Right to attack political correctness, multiculturalism and so on.\n\nChristian mobilisation\n\nThe Christian Right has developed a variety of strategies to enhance and consolidate its political power. One of the key methods is to mobilise Christian pastors and churches to get the Christian vote out. This is done, among other things, through training workshops for pastors on the voting behaviour of churchgoers. Detailed voter guides that can be trawled zip code by zip code for any election are available online. An organisation called United in Purpose claims to have \u201cpretty much the whole voting population\u201d in its database; it builds profiles and produces voter guidance to distribute both online and in person through volunteers, in an effort to get 75% of the country\u2019s 90 million Christians to vote. It is particularly striking from \u201cPower Worshippers\u201d that while Republican politicians do everything they can to suppress the black vote, the Christian Right is busy turning out its white and Latino base to vote Republican.\n\nTrump\u2019s ascension to power has extended the reach of religious conservatives. Ralph Drollinger, a former basketball pro and leader of Capitol Ministries conducts a weekly Bible Study in the White House that at one point was attended by 11 of 15 cabinet secretaries including vice president Mike Pence, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, education secretary Betsy DeVos and former attorney general Jeff Sessions. There are additional Bible Study groups in the Senate and House of Representatives and Drollinger wants to institute them in all fifty state capitals. It\u2019s not clear what these groups discuss but preachers like Drollinger are clear that the Bible mandates a range of policy positions including low taxes, support for the death penalty, denying access to abortion and little environmental regulation. Drollinger believes that the Bible is against social welfare programs and he thinks those who are on subsistence programs and pay no income tax should have their voting rights curtailed. Evangelicals are also busy in flooding the courts with petitions to roll back rights that have been gained by marginalised groups and generally make officials at the state and national level aware of their organising power.\n\nThere are, to be sure, several prominent progressive Christians who speak out on racial injustice and inequality and denounce Trump, but they are outflanked in influence by their more well-funded conservative peers who see Trump as God\u2019s anointed, a contemporary Cyrus no less, who speaks his mind on immigrants, liberals, Muslims, abortion, guns and Blacks. Trump has given evangelicals what they want: more conservative judges at the Supreme and appellate courts, newer restrictive conditions for abortions, and cuts to federal funds for public schools. In return, evangelicals assure his control over the Republican party.\n\nThe implication of this is that the Christian Right now has the institutional power to hijack the Republican party and propel and keep a figure like Trump in power. What is disconcerting is that they are all united in their opposition to immigrants; religious leaders have either supported Trump or quietly acquiesced with his rhetoric and policies concerning foreigners, including insults directed at Mexicans, making comments on \u201cshit hole countries\u201d and asking Congressional colleagues why the US should take in more immigrants from Haiti and Africa when it should be getting more from countries like Norway.\n\nAnti-immigration policies\n\nTrump has also amplified the voices of the alt-right during his presidency, giving prominent places to figures like Stephen Miller in his administration, who wants to restrict legal immigration. Since evangelicals see Trump as God\u2019s chosen they do not censure him when he traffics in illiberal, majoritarian rhetoric. In Unholy, Posner carefully surveys the cast of prominent white nationalists whose views have prominent play in the public sphere during the Trump years. And in a particularly illuminating section, Posner elaborates on the links between the American Right and their counterparts in Russia.\n\nWeyrich himself made several trips to Russia and became a \u201ccheerleader of Vladimir Putin.\u201d He wrote in 1990 that \u201cif the Judeo-Christian culture is to survive and renew itself, it needs to reunite \u2013 from California to a non-communist Russia.\u201d Others in the movement see Russia as an essential component for saving \u201cChristendom\u201d from Islam. Another conservative, William Lind, argued that Russia \u201cholds the West\u2019s \u2013 and Christendom\u2019s\u2014vast open flank that faces east and south. If that flank collapses, we will soon find Islam once again at the gates of Vienna.\u201d Putin is admired by the US Religious Right for his suppression of LGBTQ rights, general denunciation of liberals and kowtowing to tradition and the church \u2013 and they see him as someone politicians in the US can emulate.\n\nThe American Right is also in thrall of far-right figures in Europe. European groups rightwing groups are invited to events such as the Conservative Political Action Conference, which has given speaking slots to France\u2019s National Front leaders and UK\u2019s Nigel Farage. Netherland\u2019s Geert Wilders, \u201cone of the world\u2019s most notorious Islamophobes\u201d, has spoken at Conservative meetings in the US and was invited to the Republican National Convention in 2016. American and European right-wing figures also convene at the annual World Congress of Families, which has in its two-decade existence, \u201crepeatedly warned that the West faces a \u2018demographic winter\u2019, caused by a decline in white Christian fertility coupled with Muslim immigration.\u201d\n\nHungary\u2019s leader Viktor Orban and Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini hosted the WCF in Budapest and Verona in 2017 and 2019 respectively. Orban gets a lot of praise in the US for anti-immigration outlook, the WCF lauded him in 2018 for championing biblical values and conservative American politicians even challenge the State Department\u2019s criticism of Hungary and other right-wing governments in Eastern Europe.\n\nImplications for Indians\n\nInterested stakeholders in the US such as Indian Americans, the Indian diaspora, its middle class in India, and the Modi government have plenty of reasons to be concerned by these political shifts in the West. A religious faction that has a history of opposing civil rights is seeking to Christianise America with a pronounced majoritarian flavour. Christian and white nationalist forces in the US, Europe and Russia are consolidating links, sharing political tactics and committed to undermining liberals and keeping immigrants out \u2013 and these trend lines will outlive Trump.\n\nA few implications follow for now: There is a contradiction between what Trump\u2019s base wants and what Modi supporters in India and America want. The former largely wants more a white Christian America while the latter is invested in a more accommodating, liberal America. Trump is unable to paper over such differences despite being friendly to Modi. His administration has been steadily pushing a hardline on immigration; it is seeking new restrictions on H1-B visas and is under domestic pressure to drastically cut or eliminate the guest worker visas and also end the Optional Training Program (OPT), in \u201cwhich more than 100,000 Indian students in the U.S. are enrolled in at any given time en route to full time employment.\u201d The US is also reportedly aiming to shrink legal immigration as part of a broader effort to end \u201cchain migration\u201d which enables immigrants to bring their extended family to the US.\n\nIn that light, Modi\u2019s attempts to curry favour with Trump by getting his supporters to back Trump at the Houston rally is totally out of line with the interests of his constituents. Modi may fancy himself as one of the world\u2019s strongmen in power, alongside Trump, Boris Johnson, Vladimir Putin and Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro. But there\u2019s a difference: the Indian prime minister is the odd man out in this right-wing universe, representing a population that other leaders and their constituents do not want more of. State instrumentalities can tide over contradictions only up to a point. Modi can buy weapons and strike deals with Trump but he cannot move the needle on what India\u2019s middle class wants, which is more access to the West.\n\nAs a consequence, Indian Americans and India\u2019s middle class have to recognise that they now have a stake in the preservation of a liberal order in the West which assures their movement and prospects. There is an ongoing fight for that order between progressives and conservatives, starkly so in the US now, and participating in that struggle is not only an imperative but it will entail building coalitions with other racial minorities and liberals in Western countries.\n\nSuch cooperation is, however, untenable if Indians (at home and away) back an illiberal Hindutva regime that oppresses Muslims in India. The BJP\u2019s anti-Muslim politics have already put the Modi government at odds with those in the Democratic party including those like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others on Capitol Hill \u2013 and even Joe Biden will be susceptible to pressures from the Left about India, if he wins in November. Indians cannot, in addition to this, have a reputation for Muslim bashing and yet be seen as backing Black Lives Matter. They cannot be advocating for liberalism abroad while simultaneously approving what the Modi regime does to minorities at home. In other words, they cannot be against the Christianisation of America while being for Hinduisation of India. The US and the West can, in fairness, be only as open, free and just for Indians as they make India to be.\n\nSushil Aaron is a commentator on India\u2019s politics and international affairs. Twitter:@SushilAaron.\n\nThis article was first published on American Kahani.","11":"There is a measure of support among the Indian American community and India\u2019s middle class for President Donald Trump. Fewer than 20% of Indian Americans are said to have backed Trump in 2016. That number is expected to rise after Prime Minister Narendra Modi nudged the community to support Trump when he said \u201cab ki baar, Trump sarkar\u201d at the joint rally at Houston last September.\n\nIt is not inconceivable, despite ongoing protests over the murder of George Floyd, that a section of Indian Americans may yet vote for Trump in the November\u2019s election. The question is do they realise that their support for Trump\u2019s second term would amount to signing on for more Christianisation of the US?\n\nTrump is pandering to his religious base because he is dependent on the Christian Right for his re-election. As the Christian activist Ralph Reed once explained the importance of the Christian right for the Republican party:\n\n\u201cIf you take evangelicals who are 27% of the electorate and you add to them 11% of the electorate that are frequent Mass-attending Catholic, it\u2019s 38% of the electorate, and 56% of the entire Republican vote nationwide. If that vote goes away, the Republican Party ceases to exist as a reliable political party.\u201d\n\nIn turn, the Christian Right has been organising for decades preparing for a figure like Trump and has used his presidency to extend its political and cultural reach.\n\nIndian Americans and India\u2019s middle class need to reckon with these realities and their effects. Two new important books provide a firm grasp on the phenomena of increasing power of the Christian Right and white nationalists in Trump\u2019s America. Katherine Stewart\u2019s The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism and Sarah Posner\u2019s Unholy: Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump offer a fascinating glimpse of the individuals, organiaations and networks that are working to wrest power away from the Democrats and traditional moderate Republicans within the GOP. Importantly, they also highlight how the Christian Right is linking up right-wing movements in Russia and Europe, changing Western political cultures from within, in ways that they will not be friendly to immigrants and foreigners.\n\nA little bit of genealogy is in order. The conservative, dominant strand of the Christian Right began to organise politically to counter the end of segregation in public schools which the federal government was pushing following the Supreme Court\u2019s 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There is an erroneous belief that the evangelical foray into politics was motivated by outrage over the Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion. In actual fact, Protestant evangelicals were not opposed to abortion in the early 1970s as Roman Catholics were. Posner points out that the Southern Baptist Convention approved a resolution two years before Roe allowing for legal abortion \u201cunder such circumstances as rape, incest, clear evidence of fetal abnormality\u201d and where the emotional, mental and physical health of the mother was threatened.

According to reports, the US labor department estimates that as many as 41 million Americans have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the proposed visa suspension could continue into the government\u2019s new fiscal year starting October 1, when new visas are issued. This would affect the movement of H1-B holders from coming into the United States from other countries. The H1-B is an especially sought-after work visa, especially for Indian technology professionals. In either case, in the past few years, US visa rejection rates for Indian IT companies have shot up, from 6 per cent in 2015 to 24 per cent in 2019. By one estimate, Indian firms take nearly 70 per cent of the 85,000 H1-B visas applied for annually. According to a study by American think-tank the Economic Policy Institute, 60 per cent of H1-B workers are paid below the median wage for the job.\n\nThe United States is a major market for India\u2019s large IT services companies, which send several IT professionals from India to that country on H1-B visas to save on costs. The visa suspension could force companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro to increase local hiring in the US, adding to their wage bill.

According to reports, the US labor department estimates that as many as 41 million Americans have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the proposed visa suspension could continue into the government\u2019s new fiscal year starting October 1, when new visas are issued. This would affect the movement of H1-B holders from coming into the United States from other countries. The H1-B is an especially sought-after work visa, especially for Indian technology professionals. In either case, in the past few years, US visa rejection rates for Indian IT companies have shot up, from 6 per cent in 2015 to 24 per cent in 2019. By one estimate, Indian firms take nearly 70 per cent of the 85,000 H1-B visas applied for annually. According to a study by American think-tank the Economic Policy Institute, 60 per cent of H1-B workers are paid below the median wage for the job.\n\nThe United States is a major market for India\u2019s large IT services companies, which send several IT professionals from India to that country on H1-B visas to save on costs. The visa suspension could force companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro to increase local hiring in the US, adding to their wage bill. Employee expenses make up nearly 65 per cent of total operating costs for large IT services companies.

The book is poised to further burden Trump's already struggling effort to secure a second term.\n\nIn the book, which is scheduled to be released next week, Bolton describes a discussion between Trump and Xi at last year's Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan. Bolton writes that Trump was \"pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win\" but said he could not print the president's exact words because of the government's pre-publication review process for classified material forbade it, according to the excerpt.\n\nThe former top security aide said the result was emblematic of \"the confluence in Trump's mind of his own political interests and U.S. national interests,\" writing that he routinely made foreign policy choices in order to benefit himself politically.\n\n\"I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my White House tenure that wasn't driven by re-election calculations,\" Bolton writes.\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to stop the book's publication, and on Wednesday night asked a federal judge in Washington to grant an emergency restraining order. But the New York Times and the Washington Post have both published reports on Bolton's book on Wednesday after obtaining copies.\n\nTrump earlier told the Wall Street Journal that Bolton was \"a liar\" and offered a vindication of his foreign policies.\n\nIn an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News Wednesday night, Trump said that Bolton \"broke the law, very simple.

While Trump said Monday that \"maybe he's not telling the truth,\" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday the book is \"full of classified information\" without denying Bolton's assertions.\n\nRe-Election Lens\n\nBolton claims that Trump views China policy entirely through the lens of his re-election, fixated on securing a trade deal at the expense of almost everything else. That, according to Bolton, raises the possibility that Trump's recent tough talk about China's role in the coronavirus pandemic is nothing more than bluster that may dissolve if he wins re-election.\n\n\"The Trump presidency is not grounded in philosophy, grand strategy or policy,\" Bolton writes. \"It is grounded in Trump. That is something to think about for those, especially China realists, who believe they know what he will do in a second term.\"\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said it was \"absolutely untrue\" that Trump asked Xi for help with the 2020 U.S. election during trade talks in Japan last year. Lighthizer made the statement in Senate testimony on Wednesday.\n\nBolton writes that last year, Trump offered to reverse criminal prosecutions against Huawei Technology Companies Ltd. if it would help secure a phase-one trade deal with China.\n\nBolton also said Trump did not study the weighty issues facing the country and knew little about other nations he dealt with. For example, Bolton writes that the president asked if Finland was part of Russia and expressed surprise upon hearing the United Kingdom is a nuclear power, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe lack of knowledge put the president at a severe disadvantage when dealing with leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Bolton said in an interview with ABC News.\n\n\"I think Putin thinks he can play him like a fiddle. I think Putin is smart, tough. I think he sees that he's not fazed with a serious adversary here. I don't think he's worried about Donald Trump,\" Bolton said in a clip that aired Wednesday.\n\nThe book, titled \"The Room Where It Happened,\" could have lasting consequences for Trump's campaign, which has already been bedeviled by the president's response to nationwide protests against police brutality and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump is trailing his presumptive opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, in national polls and in many polls of key swing states.\n\n\"If these accounts are true, it's not only morally repugnant, it's a violation of Donald Trump's sacred duty to the American people to protect America's interests and defend our values,\" Biden said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nIn asking for the emergency restraining order on Wednesday night, the government argued that the book contained classified information and that Bolton failed to get approval to have it published.\n\nJohn Bolton also said Trump did not study the weighty issues facing the country and knew little about other nations he dealt with.\n\nThe injunction should \"instruct his publisher to take any and all available steps to retrieve and destroy any copies of the book that may be in the possession of any third party,\" the government said in court papers.\n\nThe Justice Department on Monday filed a lawsuit seeking to block publication.\n\nThe legal wrangling, combined with Trump's heated criticism of Bolton, has generated interest in the book, which has become a number-one best seller on Amazon.com ahead of its publication. Many former Trump aides have published accounts of their time in the White House, but none who held as high-ranking a position as Bolton.\n\nAt the very least, the book could undercut the Trump campaign's argument that the president is far tougher on China than Biden would be, if elected. Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. has taken to using the hashtag #BejingBiden in tweets and has accused the Democratic nominee of failing to recognize the threat posed by China's Communist Party.\n\nChina Concessions\n\nThe list of Trump's concessions to China are long, according to Bolton. He was uninterested in supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters last year and told Xi in the summer of 2019 that building camps in the Xinjiang region to imprison hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslim was \"exactly the right thing to do.\"\n\nTrump, in the Wall Street Journal interview, said he did not give his assent to Xi's plan for the widespread detentions in Xinjiang. And in the interview with Hannity, the president said, \"Nobody has been tough on China and nobody has been tough on Russia like I have. And that's in the record books and it's not even close. The last administration did nothing on either.\"\n\nThe description of Trump's policies in Bolton's book will lend credence to Democrats' claims that the president's actions essentially gave China a green light to carry out some of its most egregious abuses, including its crackdown on Uighurs and its decision to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong.\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday that Trump had signed a bill rebuking the Beijing government over its treatment of the Uighurs minutes after the book excerpts were published.\n\nDefending Taiwan, according to Bolton, also isn't a priority for the president. He describes Trump as being deferential and at times downright obsequious to Xi, at one point calling him the greatest Chinese leader in 300 years -- and then amending it to \"the greatest leader in Chinese history.\"\n\nThe revelations came out at almost the exact time that Secretary of State Michael Pompeo was meeting China's top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, for secretive talks at the Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. Both sides have so far refused to discuss the agenda for the talks.\n\nBolton argues that House Democrats could have expanded their impeachment inquiry beyond Ukraine to focus on what the former security aide called a \"pattern of fundamentally unacceptable behavior that eroded the very legitimacy of the presidency.\"\n\nBut Bolton has also faced backlash from critics for his refusal to testify in the House's impeachment inquiry. He said he wanted to wait to see if a judge would rule if he he could testify despite White House objections.\n\nHe offered to testify during the Senate's trial of Trump's impeachment. Republicans who control the chamber voted not to hear from him before acquitting the president.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Bolton also wrote that Trump said he was willing to stop U.S. criminal probes \"to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked,\" citing cases involving China's ZTE Corp. and Turkey's Halkbank. Bolton writes the president sought to seek favor with Xi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan through the offers.\n\n\"The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn't accept,\" Bolton writes, according to the Times, adding that he expressed his concern directly to Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\nBloomberg News reported last October that Erdogan made multiple appeals to Trump to avoid charges against Halkbank, one of Turkey's biggest lenders. Trump assigned Barr and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to look into the issue after an April phone conversation with Erdogan.\n\nNo action was taken for months after the call, but U.S. prosecutors released an undated indictment in October accusing the bank of fraud, money laundering and violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","19":"Former National Security Advisor John Bolton writes in a new book that President Donald Trump asked Chinese leader Xi Jinping to help him win re-election by buying more U.S. farm products, according to an excerpt published by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe disclosure is part of a devastating portrayal of Trump's conduct of foreign policy by Bolton, the most senior official in this White House so far to publish an account of his experience.

The Trump administration has been trying to stop the book's publication, and on Wednesday night asked a federal judge in Washington to grant an emergency restraining order. The book, titled \"The Room Where It Happened,\" could have lasting consequences for Trump's campaign, which has already been bedeviled by the president's response to nationwide protests against police brutality and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Bolton writes that Trump was \"pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win\" but said he could not print the president's exact words because of the government's pre-publication review process for classified material forbade it, according to the excerpt. While Trump said Monday that \"maybe he's not telling the truth,\" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday the book is \"full of classified information\" without denying Bolton's assertions. The former top security aide said the result was emblematic of \"the confluence in Trump's mind of his own political interests and U.S. national interests,\" writing that he routinely made foreign policy choices in order to benefit himself politically. The description of Trump's policies in Bolton's book will lend credence to Democrats' claims that the president's actions essentially gave China a green light to carry out some of its most egregious abuses, including its crackdown on Uighurs and its decision to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong.
